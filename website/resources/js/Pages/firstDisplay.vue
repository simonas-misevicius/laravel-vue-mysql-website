        Miso-Butter Roast Chicken With Acorn Squash Panzanella,"['1 (3½–4-lb.)
        whole chicken', '2¾ tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more', '2 small
        acorn squash (about 3 lb. total)', '2 Tbsp. finely chopped sage', '1
        Tbsp. finely chopped rosemary', '6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, plus 3
        Tbsp. room temperature', '¼ tsp. ground allspice', 'Pinch of crushed red
        pepper flakes', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '⅓ loaf good-quality
        sturdy white bread, torn into 1"" pieces (about 2½ cups)', '2 medium
        apples (such as Gala or Pink Lady; about 14 oz. total), cored, cut into
        1"" pieces', '2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '½ small red onion,
        thinly sliced', '3 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar', '1 Tbsp. white miso', '¼
        cup all-purpose flour', '2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature', '¼
        cup dry white wine', '2 cups unsalted chicken broth', '2 tsp. white
        miso', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper']","Pat chicken dry with
        paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together
        with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour. Meanwhile, halve
        squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of
        squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into ½""-thick wedges;
        arrange on a rimmed baking sheet. Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp.
        melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on
        baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and ½
        tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat. Add bread, apples,
        oil, and ¼ tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black
        pepper and toss to combine. Set aside. Place onion and vinegar in a
        small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing
        occasionally, until ready to serve. Place a rack in middle and lower
        third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature
        butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels,
        then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large
        cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F,
        50–60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165°F while chicken rests.)
        Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a
        plate; reserve skillet. Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until
        mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved
        bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage.
        Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and
        apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled
        onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish. Using your
        fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine. Set reserved
        skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about ¼
        cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly
        more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often
        and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are
        loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell
        the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often,
        until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved
        drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened,
        6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with
        salt and black pepper. Serve chicken with gravy and squash panzanella
        alongside.",miso-butter-roast-chicken-acorn-squash-panzanella,"['1
